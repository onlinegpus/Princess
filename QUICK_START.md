### Why Not Railway?
Railway is for complex apps, not simple HTML. Netlify and Vercel are made for static sites and work perfectly!

### Which One is Better?
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop, no Git needed
- **Vercel**: Connects to GitHub, great if you use Git

Both are excellent! Choose whichever you prefer.

Yes! Both Netlify and Vercel have free tiers perfect for this website.
